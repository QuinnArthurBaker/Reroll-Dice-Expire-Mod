    <description>Think the D Infinity is too strong? Want your D4 runs to be even more chaotic??

This mod adds a sense of impermanence to the D4, D100, and DInfinity. Every reroll has a 10% chance to remove the die, leaving you stuck with your latest reroll. For the D Infinity, this only occurs when it imitates the D4 or D100.</description>
